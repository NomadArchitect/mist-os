Description:

## What is this crate used for?

ring is a core set of cryptographic operations exposed via an easy-to-use API.

* Are there any use restrictions? i.e. only for development hosts

ring is limited in access by a visibility list.

* What differs from upstream? Include a changelog if feasible.

This is a fork of ring to cherry-pick
https://github.com/briansmith/ring/pull/2152, which hasn't been included in a
release yet. It also removes the `third_party/NIST` directory, which is only
needed for tests.

* Are there any restrictions to how it should be rolled?

Consult with //third_party/rust_crates/OWNERS.

* Is there anything else which makes this dependency "special"?

No.
