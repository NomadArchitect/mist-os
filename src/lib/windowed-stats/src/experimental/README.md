The `experimental` module provides APIs for round-robin multi-resolution time
series and more. The APIs in this module represent a shift in the scope and
goals of this crate and so development of these features will happen in this
module prior to moving its contents to the crate root and replacing the original
APIs.

See the glossary in `series/glossary.md` for information about time series
concepts and components.
