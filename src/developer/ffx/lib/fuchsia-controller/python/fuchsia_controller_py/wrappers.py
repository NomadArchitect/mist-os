class AsyncAdapterError(Exception):
    """Raised when an asyncmethod is used outside of an AsyncAdapter."""


class AsyncAdapter(object):
    """A wrapper or mixin that supports async calls in a synchronous context.

    This can be used with any object where you wish to expose functions as
    synchronous when in reality they are implemented in async. This is for
    convenience in areas like Mobly where tests are expected to be run as
    synchronous methods. Or in places where you intend to have things like
    `asyncio.Queue` used across multiple function calls.

    The implementation is simple: the class using this adapter is given an
    async loop to itself. This is the main loop used for every function call
    to this object.

    To expose an async function as synchronous, just use the `asyncmethod`
    decorator.

    For example:

    ```python
    class TestClass(AsyncAdapter, BaseTestClass):

        @asyncmethod
        async def foo(self):
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
    ```

    In the above, the `foo` method will be exposed as a synchronous method,
    but inside it is async code.

    If you're using this AsyncAdapter as a mixin and you're getting exceptions
    when using the `asyncmethod` decorator, make sure to put this first in the
    inheritance order to ensure proper initialization based on Python's
    method resolution order.
