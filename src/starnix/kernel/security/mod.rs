//! This module provides types and hook APIs supporting Linux Security Modules
//! functionality in Starnix.  LSM provides a generic set of hooks, and opaque
//! types, used to decouple the rest of the kernel from the details of any
//! specific security enforcement subsystem (e.g. SELinux, POSIX.1e, etc).
//!
//! Although this module is hard-wired to the SELinux implementation, callers
//! should treat the types as opaque; hook implementations necessarily have access
//! to kernel structures, but not the other way around.
