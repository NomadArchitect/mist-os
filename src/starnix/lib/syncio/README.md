# Sync IO Bindings

This library provides low-level bindings to the Fuchsia
[zxio library](/sdk/lib/zxio) used to facilitate synchronous interop with
the `fuchsia.io` and socket protocols.

For the more common asynchronous use case, see:
[`//src/lib/fuchsia-fs`](/src/lib/fuchsia-fs).

These bindings are auto-generated by the `generate.py` script which can be
run using either the pre-built or host Python 3 binary.
