The rust-netlink project contains several Rust crates for interacting with the
NETLINK API. See the individual subdirectories for the crates used by Fuchsia.
Note that each crate has it's own license, as refered to by each subdirectory's
README.fuchsia file.

Each subdirectory is a fork of upstream. At this point, there is no intention of
re-merging with upstream.
