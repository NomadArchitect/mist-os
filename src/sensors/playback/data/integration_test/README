Integration Test Datasets
-------------------------

File: accel_gyro_dataset

This file contains 2 seconds of procedurally generated accelerometer and
gyroscope data. There are 200 accelerometer samples and 20 gyroscope
samples with timestamps generated such that they will be played back at
100 Hz and 10 Hz respectively. The actual sample data is not really
meaningful, it just cyles through [1, 0, 0] -> [0, 1, 0] -> [0, 0, 1].

The function which creates the file is CreateProtoDataFile() in
playback_integration_test.cc. The data file can be regenerated by removing
DISABLED from the test DISABLED_GenerateTestDatasetProtoFile and running
the tests with the --ffx-output-directory flag.
