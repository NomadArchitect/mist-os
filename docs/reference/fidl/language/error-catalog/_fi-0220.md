## fi-0220: Name not found in version range {:#fi-0220}

This error occurs when a name cannot be found at a particular version, but it is
found in other versions. For example, an element `Foo` added at version 1 cannot
reference another element `Bar` added at version 2, because `Bar` does not exist
at version 1:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0220.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

In this case, we can fix the error add an `@available` attribute to make `Foo`
added at version 2 as well:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0220.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```
