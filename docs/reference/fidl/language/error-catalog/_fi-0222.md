## fi-0222: `@no_resource` is an experimental attribute {:#fi-0222}

The `@no_resource` annotation is experimental and only meant to be used by a few
specific protocols.

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0222.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

The annotation activates new compiler errors but doesn't have any effect on
semantics. It should be fine to just remove it.
