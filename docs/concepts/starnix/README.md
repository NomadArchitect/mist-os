# Starnix

Starnix is a [runner][starnix-runner] that allows unmodified Linux programs to run on
a Fuchsia system. Linux programs on Fuchsia are run in a user-space process whose
system interface is compatible with the Linux ABI (application binary interface).
Instead of using the Linux kernel to implement this interface, Fuchsia implements the
interface in a Fuchsia user-space program called Starnix. Starnix then serves as
a compatibility layer that translates requests (syscalls) from Linux programs to the
appropriate Fuchsia subsystems.

## Table of contents

- [**Making Linux syscalls in Fuchsia**][making-linux-syscalls]: Describes how Starnix
  handles Linux system calls in Fuchsia.
- [**Starnix container**][starnix-container]: Explains how Starnix containers
  enable Linux binaries to run in different Linux environments.
- [**Architecture of the Starnix VFS**][starnix-vfs]: Explains the key concepts and
  structure of Starnix's virtual file system (VFS).
