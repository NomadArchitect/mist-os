# Parameters: same as go_build, along with
#
#   gopackage (optional)
#     The go package containing the main function.
#
#   library (optional)
#     The GN label for the go_library containing the main function. Alternative
#     to gopackage.
#
#   embed (optional)
#     Only used by Bazel-converted go_binaries.
#     Alternative to library, should contain exactly one element.
#     Type: list of labels
#
#   source_dir, sources
#     Same meaning as defined in go_library.gni.
