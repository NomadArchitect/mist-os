# SDK E2E Tests

## Overview

This directory contains utilities for generating an out-of-tree workspace,
which can be used to execute tests as if they live in a full featured
bazel SDK based OOT repository. See
`utils/generate_test_workspace/README.md` for more information.

This directory also contains the e2e tests themselves, in `tests/`.
