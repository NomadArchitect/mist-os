# These wire up the compiler from CI and customize the build for the Rust CI
# environment in a few ways:
#
# - Don't fail the build because of new warnings, since we don't use the pinned
#   compiler version.
# - Disable debuginfo, which speeds up the build by about 8%.
# - Disable some rustc wrapper scripts that perform unnecessary build checks.
# - Build the bundle of unit tests called "minimal".

# `fx set` creates a file called `out/default/args.gn` with the build arguments
# and then runs GN, Fuchsia's meta-build system which generates ninja files. You
# may also modify args.gn directly and rerun the build, which will pick up the
