/// Cobalt is the Fuchsia service used to log, collect and analyze metrics.
/// The two main pillars of Cobalt are protecting user privacy and providing
/// high-quality, aggregate metrics to serve system and component software
/// developers' needs.
///
/// This file contains interfaces that allow clients to log Events to
/// Cobalt.
///
/// To use Cobalt, you must have a Project and one or more Metrics registered
/// with the Cobalt registration system. You must also register one or more
/// Reports in order to see the results of your logging aggregated over
/// all Fuchsia devices. Registration of Projects, Metrics and Reports consists
/// of entries in the YAML files in this repo:
/// https:///cobalt-analytics.googlesource.com/config/.
/// In a Garnet checkout that is mapped to ///third_party/cobalt_config.
/// Each registered object has an integer ID and those IDs are used as
/// parameters in the methods in this file.
///
/// While Cobalt's code and registration files are open source, the running
/// system being managed by the Cobalt team is currently intended to be used by
/// software engineers at Google in order to collect metrics in a way that
/// preserves our users' privacy. If you are a Google software engineer
/// please see our internal [user guide](http://go/fuchsia-cobalt-userguide) or
/// ask for assistance from the Cobalt [team](http://go/fuchsia-cobalt#comms).
///
/// Usage: First use LoggerFactory to get a Logger for your
/// project. Then you log Events using the Log*() methods.
/// Events are accumulated by the cobalt FIDL service and periodically
/// Observations, derived from the logged Events, are sent to the Cobalt server,
/// where they are used to generate Reports.
